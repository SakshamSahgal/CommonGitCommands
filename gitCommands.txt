//how to initialize a new repo

first create a new repo on github

then do -
git init                                                 //initialize a new repo        
now make some files here
git add .
git commit -m "msg"
git branch -M main                                      //renaming the current branch to main (here -M means move) (original name was master) 
git remote add origin <remote-url>                      //it publishes the changes to the remote repo [you have to do it first time]


Basic Commands

git add .  					                            //add all modification to staging area
git commit -m "message"                                 //creates a new commit in the repo
git push origin				                            //upload all branch commits to a remote repository


git status    				                            //tells which files are modified in current branch
git branch    				                            //list all existing branches in the repository and also tells current branch
git branch <branch name> 	                            //creates a new branch
git checkout <branch name>	                            //switches branches

to merge - 

git checkout main 			                            //to switch to main 
git merge <branch name>		                            //to merge the branch into main


after that resolve any merge conficts in vs code 

[make sure to do it while on the main branch]

then do - 

git add .
git commit -m "msg"
git push origin 

//to push the resolved conflicts to main branch

how to publish newly created branch - 

git branch <new branch name>
git checkout <new branch name>
// do some changes now

git add .
git commit -m "msg"
git push -u origin <branch name>                        //this publishes the branch to the remote repo
